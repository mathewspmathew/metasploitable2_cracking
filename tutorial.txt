Step 1: Setting up VM ware environment
      : download and install it. 
      : download iso file of Kali Linux and Metasploitable2 and add that to VM ware 
      
Step 2: Make sure that both the OS are connected on same network.
      : We are using NAT. Go on to settngs and connect to that in both OS.
      Now we are half way done !
      
Step 3: Open both OS at same time
      : scan using ifconfig
      now we have got our IP address
      
      :Scan our network-
          eg - sudo nmap -sV -O 192.268.0/24
      : Vulnerability OS(Mestaploitable) is displayed and its vulnerabilities.

Step 4: Open msfconsole 
      : Search for the exploit of which vulnerability found
      : Use the exploit
      : set RHOST as the targated machine
      : type run command
      
      Here we go!
      
      The shell is found and exoplore the OS
